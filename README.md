The Dark Forest Enhanced Edition is an upcoming native PC port of the original text-based adventure game released in 2022, coming out on **Saturday, April 26 at 12pm EST**. 
Running on a brand new, in house engine we call LetopaCore, we have overhauled every single aspect of the game. No line of code has been left untouched.
# Features:
* **Expanded replayability**
	* **New Difficulty System**
		* We have tweaked the difficulty of the original game, making it more fair and less frustrating
		* Difficulties can now scale RNG mechanics and allow you to tweak your game experience
		* To add to this flexibility, we've introduced two new difficulty levels:
			* Story Mode
				* Take less damage and have more chances of survival. Ideal for those who want to play just for the story.
			* Original
				* The original difficulty. Unforgiving but not impossible.
	* **New Game+**
		* After beating the game on a save file, you can replay it
		* Features the most challenging game experience
		* Includes four exclusive and challenging boss fights 
	* **Replayable Boss Fights**
		* After beating the game, you can replay full boss fights at any time
	* **Chapter System**
		* We've now split the game into four chapters
		* After beating the game you can replay any individual one
	* **Multiple Save Slots**
		* We've fully designed the save system, now allowing you to have up to six saves at the same time.
* **Statistics Tracking**
	* In any save file, you can view multiple things about your run, including:
		* Achievements collected
		* Time played
		* Number of deaths
	* **Achievements**
		* You'll now receive a number of achievements for progressing through the game, such as:
			* Completing chapters
			* Beating boss fights
			* Beating the game on different difficulty levels
			* Finding (new) secrets
			* Completing New Game+
* **Extreme Polish**
	* We've spent a long time making sure the game runs flawlessly on a technical level for everyone
	* We've fixed many bugs and crashes, to the point where one of our beta testers encountered zero issues in a full playthrough
* **The Dark Cave Integration**
	* The Dark Cave spin off has been seamlessly ported into the base game, meaning there's zero delay when getting into it
* **Modernized Controls**
	* We've redesigned how the controls system works, using the number keys for many niche interactions rather than random keys on the keyboard
* **Settings UI**
	* You can now tweak your save file from anywhere within the game, changing things like:
		* Difficulty
		* Toggling text scrolling
* **Pause Menu**
	* Pause the game by inputting `p` at any time to access:
		* The settings UI
		* Quit to menu/desktop
		* Checkpoint reload
* **Death Screen**
	* Upon dying, you can now choose to leave the game and see some other data, rather than having the game instantly close
* **So much more!**

We at Letopa have put an insane amount of work into this release. Without further ado, here are the supported platforms:
